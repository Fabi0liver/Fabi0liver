 👋 Hello! **I'm Fábio**, a student delving into the fascinating world of programming. 
     Currently, I'm focused on learning programming logic and Python. 
 
 💞️ I am passionate about improving my skills and discovering new languages and technologies. 
 
 👀 I'm always seeking challenges that help me grow and evolve as a developer. 

 🌱 I'm just a student at the moment, so I don't have much to show. But I hope to evolve!                     
                       
                       Let's code together!
